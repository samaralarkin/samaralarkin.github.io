<h1>Independent Game Development</h1>

<h2>Atom Dancer</h2>
<p><a href="http://squidlarkin.itch.io/atom-dancer">squidlarkin.itch.io/atom-dancer</a></p>
<p>My first commercial game project. I had created a simple simulation of objects gravitationally attracting each other, and was intrigued by how they clustered together. I came up with the idea of creating a non-violent game about interacting with these chaotic systems. The "bond-crossing" mechanic, introduced to increase both risk and reward, turned out to be the most technically challenging part of the gameplay to implement.</p>
<p>I created the game in Game Maker 8, using around 250 lines of GML code. The project taught me a lot about polishing and shipping a project, including such details as supporting multiple screen resolutions, graphic design, and documentation.<hr /></p>



<h2>Super Duper Thwackswinger</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/2007">http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/2007</a></p>
<p>A still-unfinished game that's been through several iterations, mostly to improve the usability of the controls. The version made for the 48-hour Ludum Dare competition was ranked #12 out of 213 entries in "Fun".<hr /></p>

<h2>FormVaders</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/3386">http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/3386</a></p>
<p>A joke game, programmed in under two hours in C# using Visual Studio. The goal was to use Windows Forms, particularly the DataGridView element, in ways they were never meant to be used. I succeeded.<hr /></p>

<h2>@spellwithout</h2>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/spellwithout">http://twitter.com/spellwithout</a></p>
<p>A Twitter bot that finds words inside other words. Written in Python, and based on an existing framework which I downloaded from Github and added about 60 lines of code to. Challenges included detecting and discarding uninteresting results, as well as logging to prevent repeated tweets.</p>
